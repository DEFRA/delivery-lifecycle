      <h1 class="heading-large">Vertical service teams</h1>
      <p>
        Vertical service teams are delivering a service that is closely aligned to a unique government capability.
      </p>
      <p>
        These teams have a number of characteristics that make them different to other types of team:
      </p>
      <ol class="list list-bullet">
        <li>they are likely to be building applications rather than buying them</li>
        <li>they are likely to have a small, well-defined set of user personas</li>
        <li>most of the application functionality that they are providing is intended for use by customers</li>
        <li>they will probably be closely aligned to a single Defra delivery body or system</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The size and makeup of this type of team will vary during the delivery lifecycle, but they will be closely
        aligned to the Service Manual.  The team will persist in some form for the entirety of the life of the service.
