      <p>
        During Alpha the Service Team will want to understand and assess the Horizontal Services that they may need
        to interact with.
      </p>
      <p>
        For any Horizontal Services that are in Discovery, there is an opportunity to better understand their
        user needs by incorporating real feedback from the Service Team's Alpha.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without this interaction, the service could miss an opportunity to utilise a common service in their
        solution and the Horizontal Service team is likely to end up duplicating effort eliciting user needs.

  <h2 class="heading-medium">Teams</h2>
  <p>
    These are the teams that are involved in this interaction and what they want to achieve.
  </p>

  <div class="grid-row">
    <div class="column-half">

      <h3 class="heading-small">Service team</h3>
      <p>
        "I want to know that a horizontal service I may use has properly considered my user needs."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I want to know if the horizontal service can be part of my Alpha."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I want to know what the delivery timescales are for the horizontal service."
      </p>

    </div>
    <div class="column-half">

      <h3 class="heading-small">Horizontal service teams</h3>
      <p>
        "I want to include the validated user needs for the vertical service."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I want to ensure that user needs are not being duplicated."
      </p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">Objectives</h2>
  <p>
    The objective of this interaction is to ensure that both vertical and horizontal service teams remain aligned
    in their delivery as the Alpha progresses.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">Activities</h2>
  <p>
    The service teams will work together on the following activities.
  </p>

  <h3 class="heading-small">User needs management</h3>
  <p>
    Agreeing the ownership and management of user needs as they are uncovered.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Service Team work with the Horizontal Service teams to agree the responsibility for user needs that
    they discover.
  </p>

  <h3 class="heading-small">User feedback</h3>
  <p>
    Getting feedback from users on prototypes and demonstrators.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Horizontal Service teams participate in the Service Team's feedback sessions.
  </p>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">Timing</h2>
  <p>
    This interaction should be started as soon as the horizontal services are identified as potentially being
    related to the service.
    In most cases this will be known at the start of Alpha.
  </p>
