      <p>
        During Discovery the Service Team will identify the Horizontal Services that they will need to interact
        with, or this may have already been established prior to Discovery.
      </p>
      <p>
        For any Horizontal Services that are already in Beta, there is the opportunity to gain greater understanding
        of the applications that they are delivering, which helps in planning Alpha.
      </p>
      <p>
        Equally, there is the opportunity to ensure that their development will meet the needs of the vertical service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without this interaction, the service will proceed to Alpha with incorrect assumptions and an invalid
        business case.

    These are the teams that are involved in this interaction and what they want to achieve.

  <div class="grid-row">
    <div class="column-half">

      <h3 class="heading-small">Service team</h3>
      <p>
        "I want to know which, if any, of my user needs will be met by the horizontal service."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I want to know how I can make use of the horizontal service in my Alpha."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I want to know what applications the horizontal service will deliver."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I want to know what the delivery timescales are for the horizontal service."
      </p>

    </div>
    <div class="column-half">

      <h3 class="heading-small">Horizontal service teams</h3>
      <p>
        "I want to develop against real user needs."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I want to deliver my Beta."
      </p>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">Objectives</h2>
  <p>
    The objective of this interaction is to ensure that the development of the horizontal service will meet the
    needs of the vertical service, particularly when it moves into Alpha.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">Activities</h2>
  <p>
    The service teams will work together on the following activities.
  </p>

  <h3 class="heading-small">User needs management</h3>
  <p>
    Agreeing the ownership and management of user needs as they are uncovered.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Service Team work with the Horizontal Service teams to agree how to incorporate their needs in the backlog.
  </p>
  <p>
    (We don't currently seem to have a mechanism for doing this.)
  </p>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">Timing</h2>
  <p>
    This interaction should be started as soon as the horizontal services are identified as potentially being
    related to the service.
  </p>
