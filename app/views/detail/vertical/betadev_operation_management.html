      <p>
        During Beta the Service Team will iteratively build the applications that form their service.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Operation Management function will provide development equivalents of their services and
        ready their services for the Private and Public Betas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without this, the operational applications will not be ready for continuous deployment and so Private and
        Public Betas will not be possible.

  <h2 class="heading-medium">Activities</h2>

    The service team and operation management function will work together on the following activities.
  </p>

  <h3 class="heading-small">Build development service</h3>
  <p>
    Configure and use the development service for Beta or create one if it doesn't already exist.
  </p>
  <p>
    Configuration may be performed by the Service Team or by the appropriate Operation Support function.
  </p>
  <p>
    The operation management function will provide a delivery mechanism for continuous deployment.
  </p>

  <h3 class="heading-small">Prepare the production service</h3>
  <p>
    Establish the introduction mechanism for the production service.
  </p>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">Timing</h2>
  <p>
    This interaction should be started at the beginning of Beta.
    This is to allow the development to occur.
